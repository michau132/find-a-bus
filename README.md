# find-a-bus
Find a bus is an example of using AJAX.

This app is showing actual position of single bus in Warsaw.

If you want to see how it's work just download this repo.

And open a file index.html with your browser.

In a field "Number line" write a number of a bus (for example: 520).

On map it would render a position of all buses with number 520. And it would refresh the position of a bus after 10seconds.

If you click on Find your bus stop you will see a 10 example locations of bus stops in Warsaw.
